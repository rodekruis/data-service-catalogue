## Trigger Monitoring and Early Warning Systems

This project leverages real-time data from global and national forecasts, satellites, and other sources to track Early Action Protocol (EAP) triggers and generate early warnings. These systems enable National Societies and stakeholders to monitor triggers and take preventive actions before a crisis escalates.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks forecasts and risk factors such as climate-related risks and epidemics.
- **Automated Workflow:** A trigger monitoring workflow is set up as a sequence of automated tasks that run on a computer, feeding data into each other.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts:** When pre-defined trigger thresholds are exceeded, the workflow issues warnings.
- **Actionable Warnings:** Warnings urge end-users to take specific, pre-defined anticipatory actions to mitigate the effects of hazards.

### Purpose

- Support the development and implementation of systems that continuously monitor trigger levels for the EAP.
- Enable proactive risk management and crisis prevention.
