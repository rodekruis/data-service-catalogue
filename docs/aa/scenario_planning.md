## Scenario Planning and Simulation

The final step in developing an Early Action Protocol (EAP) is to conduct a simulation exercise that tests its implementation in a realistic crisis scenario. The objective is for the National Society to self-assess its operational readiness and ability to execute the EAP effectively.

We use trigger models and early warning systems to guide these simulations. By preparing for multiple scenarios, organizations can enhance their capacity to respond quickly and efficiently during actual emergencies.

Simulation tools are developed to help stakeholders model and practice the EAP, ensuring everyone is prepared and confident in their roles.
