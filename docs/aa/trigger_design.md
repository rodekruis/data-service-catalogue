# Anticipatory Action Trigger Design

Knowing when to act to mitigate the effects of a hazard is central to anticipatory action. This document outlines our approach to designing triggers for Early Action Protocols (EAPs), using data analysis of available forecasts and insights from forecast skill assessments.

## EAP Trigger Design

We collaborate with multiple National Societies and humanitarian organizations to develop effective trigger models for EAPs. Our process is informed by data-driven analysis and practical experience to ensure timely and impactful early actions.
