## Data-Driven Risk Assessment

Our team delivers comprehensive risk assessments through advanced data analysis and strong collaborations with universities. By combining in-house expertise with academic partnerships, we ensure our risk models are robust, accurate, and actionable. Please note: the quality of our assessments depends on the availability and reliability of the underlying data.

### Key Risk Assessment Services

- **Hazard Prioritization:** Identify and prioritize hazards to support the development of Early Action Protocols (EAP).
- **Geographic Prioritization:** Determine priority areas for targeted early action based on specific hazards.
- **Epidemic Risk Assessment:** Assess and map priority areas at risk of epidemics. We have developed risk models for diseases such as dengue, malaria, measles, and cholera.

Our data-driven approach bridges expertise gaps and supports effective early action planning.
