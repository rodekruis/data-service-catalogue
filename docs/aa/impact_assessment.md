## Impact Evaluation and Learning

In collaboration with PMEL, we systematically collect and analyze data on the outcomes of anticipatory actions. These outcomes are measured against key performance indicators (KPIs) to:

- Assess the effectiveness of anticipatory actions
- Generate lessons learned
- Identify best practices for refining future actions

This process ensures continuous improvement and greater impact of our anticipatory initiatives.
