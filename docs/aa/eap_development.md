# Early Action Protocol (EAP) Development

Welcome to the EAP Development documentation. This guide outlines our approach to designing Early Action Protocols (EAPs) using Human-Centered Design (HCD) principles.

## What We Do

We facilitate collaborative workshops with National Societies to co-create EAPs tailored to local contexts. Our process emphasizes:

- **Human-Centered Design:** Actively engaging participants to address their needs, perspectives, and experiences.
- **Ownership & Collaboration:** Ensuring solutions are relevant and meaningful for National Societies and the vulnerable communities they serve.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Integrating historical data to inform hazard prioritization, early action selection, and trigger design.
- **Actionable Planning:** Defining timelines for trigger information needs and early action planning, ensuring triggers are specific, reliable, and actionable.

## Our Partners

We frequently collaborate with the [Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre](https://www.climatecentre.org/) to enhance the effectiveness of EAPs.
