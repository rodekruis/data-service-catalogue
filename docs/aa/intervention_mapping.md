# Intervention Area Mapping and Targeting

Intervention area mapping is essential for effective anticipatory action. It helps identify the communities most at risk by combining forecasted hazard data with information on exposure and vulnerability. 

When selecting intervention areas, consider that vulnerability indicators can change over time. Regularly update your data and analysis to ensure accuracy.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Overlay Data:** Combine hazard forecasts with exposure and vulnerability data.
2. **Identify At-Risk Areas:** Highlight communities and populations most at risk.
3. **Develop Maps:** Create clear maps to visualize priority intervention areas.
4. **Guide Action:** Use these maps to inform and guide the implementation of the Early Action Protocol.

By following these steps, you can ensure that interventions are targeted where they are needed most.
