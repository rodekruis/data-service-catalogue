# Hazard Exposure and Vulnerability Assessment

Understanding potential impacts is crucial in anticipatory action. Rather than focusing solely on forecasting hazards, it is important to integrate accurate forecasts with data on exposure and vulnerability. This approach helps predict how hazards may affect specific communities.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Impact** is determined by the combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
- High-quality data for each component is essential for reliable predictions.

**Our Approach:**
- **Exposure Data:**  
    We identify and evaluate the most reliable and up-to-date exposure datasets, addressing any biases or inaccuracies.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:**  
    We help select suitable data sources for vulnerability, including the use of proxy indicators to fill data gaps. Composite vulnerability indices, such as those based on the INFORM Risk Index methodology, are also considered.

By combining these elements, we support effective decision-making for anticipatory action and disaster risk reduction.
