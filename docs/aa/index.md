# Anticipatory Action

*Work in progress.*

Anticipatory Action refers to the actions taken to reduce the humanitarian impacts of a forecasted hazard before it occurs or before its most acute impacts are felt. The decision to take action is informed by impact-based forecasts and corresponding thresholds tailored to determine when, where, and how the event will unfold. We aim to enhance Anticipatory Action development and implementation. We support National Societies and other humanitarian actors with data services, capacity building, and by creating digital tools.   

By turning forecasts from descriptions of what the weather will be into assessments of what the weather will do, we enable National Societies and local humanitarian partners to leverage data and technology to make data-driven, life-saving decisions and act before disasters strike.  

Impact Based Forecasting (IBF) is a process of collecting and integrating data to predict the impact of impending disasters on local communities. ​It enables anticipatory actions to mitigate the risks posed by climate-induced extreme weather.

### CVA in Anticipatory Action
*work in progress* 

### CEA in Anticipatory Action   

Community engagement and accountability are essential components of anticipatory action, ensuring that interventions are relevant, effective, and aligned with the needs and priorities of the communities they aim to protect  

* Engage communities from the outset in setting priorities, and designing anticipatory actions. This ensures that interventions are culturally appropriate and meet the real needs of the people.  

* Establish channels for communities to provide feedback on the actions taken and their effectiveness. This feedback helps refine and improve future anticipatory actions and ensures that communities feel heard and valued. 

* Incorporate local knowledge and practices into anticipatory action plans. Communities often have deep, context-specific understanding of their environment and risks, which can enhance the effectiveness of interventions. 

* Ensure that engagement strategies are inclusive, reaching all segments of the community, including vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. This ensures that the needs of the most at-risk populations are addressed.
