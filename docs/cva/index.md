# Cash & Voucher Assistance

*Work in progress.*

Cash & Voucher Assistance (CVA) is an aid modality designed to support individuals in times of crisis. It enables people to prepare for, prioritise, and manage their own needs – from securing food and rent to covering education and healthcare expenses. Cash & Voucher Assistance places the decision-making power directly in the hands of those we serve, promoting dignity and self-sufficiency.

The International Disaster Database recorded a steady increase in the frequency of disasters over the past 35 years. As a result, the number of people affected by humanitarian crises has almost doubled over the past 10 years, whilst the cost of humanitarian assistance has tripled. For this reason, the humanitarian world is undergoing a transformation in the way that aid is delivered. This transformation goes hand in hand with the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence.​

Assistance must always reach the most vulnerable. An effective way to support people affected by disasters is through a combination of Cash & Voucher Assistance and Forecast-based Financing (FbF). FbF allows for both decisionmakers, and people affected to better prepare for and cope with disasters and thus reduce needs when disaster strikes. Cash & Voucher Assistance offers a more efficient and dignified means to deliver assistance, empowers people in need and fosters local economies.
