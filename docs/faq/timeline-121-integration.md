??? "1. What ICT is required to run the 121 platform? Do I need specific installations or additional hardware?"

     The 121 platform addresses the diverse needs of National Societies, INGOs, and NGOs, taking into account their varying digital literacy levels. Our platform streamlines operations with its straightforward requirements and swift implementation process to be deployed as rapidly as possible to comply with emergency settings.

     The 121 platform requires only a laptop/computer and an internet connection, accessible via common browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Unlike other solutions, there's no need for additional hardware, reducing setup time and costs, avoiding delays in program setup  and enabling a swift response. Notably, there are no minimum requirements, although platform performance may be affected by low internet speeds.

??? "2. How quickly can 121 platform be implemented?"

     Your 121 platform can be ready **within 7 business days** upon confirmation of the program, signature of the contract and SLA agreement. **This timeline includes the platform setup**, i.e creating your instance, activating the users credentials, designing your programs, adding a KOBO form (or alternative registration App). This does not take into account time required for contract negotiations, planning travel to destination and on-site training (1 day), which can extend the timeline. *Kindly note that this timeline is subject to change and that the program details and registration form are prepared and confirmed from your organization' program team.*

     On average, the 121 platform implementation takes between 2 to 4 weeks upon agreement, considering all above components.


??? "3. How long does the integration with an Financial Service Provider (FSP) take?"

     The 121 platform has **integrated with a number of Financial Serivce Provider (FSP) in different countries, allowing to instantly integrate the platform with your local FSP**. If an FSP integration is already in place, **our timeline is 7 business days**. We can also integrate with additional local FSPs upon request. In this case, the integration timeline can vary, depending on the level of technical complexity and the FSP response time.

     **Without an FSP integration, we offer a soft integration so you can start using 121 platform immediately**, while the integration is being processed. This works through exporting excel files including the payment information from 121 and uploading these file in the FSP portal. You will later reconcile the payments into the 121 platform. 
     
     Read more about our **Financial Service Providers (FSP)** [on this page](../faq/financial-service-provider.md). Or, contact our team to discuss the alternatives offered in your situation and country of operations at <info@121.global>.

??? "4. Can 121 platform be integrated with other third-party tool?"

     Depending on the design of your Cash and Vouchers Aid program, you may require to integrate with additional third-party tool to facilitate your operations. The 121 platform can be integrated with third-party tool, if an API is offered by the third-party provider and a framework agreement with your National Society or NGO has been contracted. 

     **The timeline can only be confirmed once our technical team has discussed with the third-party tool provider.** 


     121 platform has already integrated with a certain number of most used tools in the humanitarian sector. 
     
     - **KOBO Toolbox** for registering beneficiaries, allowing the automatic upload of beneficiaries into your 121 registration list ([see the description page](../registration/registration-automatic-import-kobo.md)). Alternative registration form tool can be integrated (API).
     - An integration with **Espo CRM** is available. Our Cash IM and technical team have experiences with Espo CRM in combination with 121 platform, particularly for complex case management. Additional requirements on hosting servers and maintenance may be discussed.
     - **A number of Financial Service Provider (FSP) in different countries** has been integrated. Further information are available [on this page](../faq/financial-service-provider.md)
     - **Redline**, the Community Engagement Hub developed by 510 unit, that allows multichannel communication and scalable engagement and
     accountability.
