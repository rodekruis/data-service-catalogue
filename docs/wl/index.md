# Water & Landscape
The  Water & Landscape thematic area supports implementing partners in mitigating the humanitarian effect of climate and environmental crises. Our team applies a systematic (watershed) approach which strives for nature-based solutions driven by data-based research and visualizations to prioritize intervention zones. The provision of recommendations to decision makers ensures to respect local knowledge and practices, and fosters robust connections with technical partners and influential entities within sectors.    

We work with our humanitarian partners to improve the way decisions are made in order to build more climate resilient communities. This is achieved through the application of data and digital technologies that build evidence to identify areas of environmental and humanitarian concern and promote nature-based solutions.
