# Site Suitability Assessment - Work in progres

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-trailing-punctuation -->
A thorough understanding of the environmental context helps decision makers plan infrastructure and service interventions that effectively and sustainably meet the needs of people affected. Within this data service, we evaluate different sites based on a set of indicators that assess their suitability for the delivery of a certain infrastructure or service. For environmental indicators, this involves assessing factors such as topography, soil type, water availability, and to proximity to infrastructure.

This service can:

+ help advise on the placement of boreholes, latrines, and other infrastructure projects to ensure they are efficiently located, with minimal environmental impact
+ assess the suitability of a site to host vaccination campaigns, considering factors such as population density and shelter options
+ help design a latrine based on the risk that it might pollute a water source.

Landscape restoration monitoring involves four steps:

1. Problem analysis:Together with the NS, identify the challenges the communities are facing with regards to landscape degradation and ecosystem loss. Based on this, formulate the objective of the restoration monitoring and identify the region of interest.
2. Indicator definition: Identify the relevant indicators based on the local context.
3. Data processing, analysis and visualization: Load and process available satellite imagery for the area of interest. Overlay the satellite images with shapefiles of areas that are undergoing reforestation. Create a graph that calculates the vegetation index per reforestation area, and the difference between compared dates.
4. Decision support: Provide insights into the improvements in landscape restoration over time and support NS with evaluating the effectiveness of their restoration interventions.
