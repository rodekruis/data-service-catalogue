## Introduction

A thorough understanding of the environmental context helps decision makers plan infrastructure and service interventions that effectively and sustainably meet the needs of people affected. Within this data service, we evaluate different sites based on a set of indicators that assess their suitability for the delivery of a certain infrastructure or service. For environmental indicators, this involves assessing factors such as topography, soil type, water availability, and to proximity to infrastructure.

This service can:
* help advise on the placement of boreholes, latrines, and other infrastructure projects to ensure they are efficiently located, with minimal environmental impact
* assess the suitability of a site to host vaccination campaigns, considering factors such as population density and shelter options
* help design a latrine based on the risk that it might pollute a water source.
