# Nature based Solution Assessment

Within climate risk management, NbS plays a critical role by utilizing nature ecosystems to reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards such as droughts and floods, thereby enhancing the resilience of both people and nature. The NbS assessment supports the development of these targeted strategies by evaluating the feasibility of implementation and the most effective locations and solutions to address various societal challenges such as climate change, disaster risk, or biodiversity loss. This service quantifies the potential impacts of various NbS options to mitigate humanitarian impacts, providing crucial insights for enhancing community resilience. 

This service can:
* Identify high risk areas of climate impacts that require NbS
* Identify suitable NbS for an area or hazard
* Analyse scenarios of climate change or human development impact on ecosystems
* Model and quantify the potential impact of different NbS

### Challenge


### Need


### Solution 
* Application of NbS at the landscape level is a transformational approach to sustainably addressing climate resilience at scale.
* Sustainably managing, restoring nature and modifying ecosystems through NbS can help address societal challenges.
* 	Nature based solutions can enable communities to prepare, cope with, and recover from disasters such as floods or slow onset events like droughts. 

Aspects Considered to ensure successful Implementation 
* Co-creation/co-designing through scoping of end-user needs
* Contextualizing solutions based on the local context (operational challenges, local language)
* Collaboration with NS who have a wider reach and network of local actors and volunteers
* Sustainability enabled by ensuring that NS are capacitated in use of the service and the service is successfully integrated in their day-to-day operations

Who benefits of doing an Nature based Solutions Assessment; 
* Communities as solutions are developed at landscape scale to enhance climate resilience at the local level.
* National societies who can integrate climate risk interventions with NbS for sustainable disaster management
* Organisations/Institutions involved in climate risk management through collaboration

### Application
NbS methodology has been applied in Kafue (Zambia) to improve the  flood resilience of people and nature in the Zambezi river basin.

Over the years, Zambia has seen an increase in droughts and floods, putting pressure on livelihoods and ecosystem services. 

With 60% of the population in Zambia below the poverty line, the rural and urban poor depend heavily on natural resources which often leads to ecosystem degradation especially in the Zambezi catchment.

### Methodology 
Nature based solutions assessment involves four steps:

1. **Data â€“ driven selection of pilot areas**: Area selection based on combined risk score for drought and flood hazards in a particular district.
2. **Systematic Identification of Nature Based Solutions**: Based on reviewing the current landscape of NbS
3. **Scenario analysis**: e.g. understanding the link between natural disasters and land cover changes
4. **Quantification of changes**: Quantifying ecosystem services lost due to land cover change
