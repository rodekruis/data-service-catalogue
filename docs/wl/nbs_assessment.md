# Nature based Solution Assessment

Within climate risk management, NbS plays a critical role by utilizing nature ecosystems to reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards such as droughts and floods, thereby enhancing the resilience of both people and nature. The NbS assessment supports the development of these targeted strategies by evaluating the feasibility of implementation and the most effective locations and solutions to address various societal challenges such as climate change, disaster risk, or biodiversity loss. This service quantifies the potential impacts of various NbS options to mitigate humanitarian impacts, providing crucial insights for enhancing community resilience. 

This service can:
* Identify high risk areas of climate impacts that require NbS
* Identify suitable NbS for an area or hazard
* Analyse scenarios of climate change or human development impact on ecosystems
* Model and quantify the potential impact of different NbS
