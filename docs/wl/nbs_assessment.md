# Nature based Solution Assessment
Nature-based Solutions (NbS) use the power of nature—like forests, wetlands, and rivers—to tackle challenges such as climate change, floods, droughts, and the loss of plants and animals. By protecting and restoring natural ecosystems, NbS helps communities deal with environmental problems while benefiting the environment itself.

The NbS Assessment is a tool that helps identify the best places to apply these solutions and determine which nature-based methods will work most effectively. It also helps communities prepare for and recover from disasters by using nature to reduce risks, like floods and droughts.

In short, NbS offers a cost-effective and sustainable way to use nature to protect people and the planet, while also improving the health of ecosystems.

How it Works
* Identify high-risk areas where floods, droughts, or other climate impacts are a concern.
* Find the right nature-based solution for that area, whether it’s planting trees, restoring wetlands, or another option.
* Measure the impact, like how much an area benefits after a solution is put in place.

### Challenge
Nature based solutions (NbS) are designed to tackle global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and disaster risk by leveraging natural processes that support the health and management of ecosystems which provide benefits and services to society. NbS focus on resolving the urgent need for integrated, nature-driven strategies to tackle environmental and social challenges at various levels.  

### Need
Environmental and social challenges are often addressed in isolation, despite the need for integrated approaches that minimize negative consequences and maximize synergies between people and nature. NbS offers a holistic approach to addressing interconnected issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food and water security, and disaster risk.

By working with nature, NbS enables cost-effective climate change mitigation and adaptation, while also protecting biodiversity and delivering multiple benefits to people. These solutions integrate natural processes into societal responses, aiming to meet the demands for ecosystem health, community resilience, and sustainable development.

### Solution 
Nature based solutions (NbS) utilize natural ecosystems and processes to address environmental challenges, including disaster risk, climate change, food security, water security and human health. These solutions provide sustainable and effective ways to mitigate and adapt to environmental issues, while offering additional benefits to both human societies and ecosystems. 

Within climate risk management (CRM), NbS plays a critical role by utilizing nature ecosystems to reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards such as droughts and floods, thereby enhancing the resilience of both people and nature. NbS assessments help identify and evaluate solutions for societal challenges such as climate change, disaster risk, and biodiversity loss.  

By applying NbS at the landscape level, communities can build resilience to climate risks in a sustainable manner. Restoring and managing natural ecosystems through NbS helps societies prepare for, cope with, and recover from disasters like floods and droughts.

Aspects Considered to ensure successful Implementation 
* Co-creation/co-designing: Solutions are developed through a scoping process that aligns with end-user needs.
* Local Context: Solutions are tailored to the specific operational and cultural context of each region.
* Collaboration: Partnerships with local actors and volunteers expand the reach of NbS.
* Sustainability: Ensuring local actors are equipped to use and integrate NbS into their day-to-day operations.

Who benefits of doing an Nature based Solutions Assessment; 
* Communities as solutions are developed at landscape scale to enhance climate resilience at the local level.
* National societies who can integrate climate risk interventions with NbS for sustainable disaster management
* Organisations/Institutions involved in climate risk management through collaboration

### Application
NbS methodology has been applied in Kafue (Zambia) to improve the  flood resilience of people and nature in the Zambezi river basin.

Over the years, Zambia has seen an increase in droughts and floods, putting pressure on livelihoods and ecosystem services. 

With 60% of the population in Zambia below the poverty line, the rural and urban poor depend heavily on natural resources which often leads to ecosystem degradation especially in the Zambezi catchment.

### Methodology 
Nature based solutions assessment involves four steps:

1. **Data – driven selection of pilot areas**: Area selection based on combined risk score for drought and flood hazards in a particular district.
2. **Systematic Identification of Nature Based Solutions**: Based on reviewing the current landscape of NbS
3. **Scenario analysis**: e.g. understanding the link between natural disasters and land cover changes
4. **Quantification of changes**: Quantifying ecosystem services lost due to land cover change

### Expected outcome
By implementing NbS, we anticipate improved ecosystem health, enhanced community resilience, and better preparedness for climate-related disasters.
