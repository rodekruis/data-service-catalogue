# Community Engagement & Accountability

*Work in progress.*

Community Engagement & Accountability (CEA) is essential to help the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement build the acceptance and trust that is needed to deliver lifesaving work. One of the most effective ways of building this trust is to make sure that people can always engage with National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and to guarantee that National Societies will act based on their feedback and needs. Achieving this requires a systematic, consistent and high-quality approach to how we engage with and are accountable to communities.

Our goal is to work with National Societies on building trust, enhancing relevance and improving the quality of programmes by providing easy-to-use, safe and transparent digital tools for meaningful and scalable engagement with communities and simple processes for creating actionable insights.

### CEA in Anticipatory Action  
*needs to be reviewed*_
Community engagement and accountability are essential components of anticipatory action, ensuring that interventions are relevant, effective, and aligned with the needs and priorities of the communities they aim to protect  

* Engage communities from the outset in setting priorities, and designing anticipatory actions. This ensures that interventions are culturally appropriate and meet the real needs of the people.  

* Establish channels for communities to provide feedback on the actions taken and their effectiveness. This feedback helps refine and improve future anticipatory actions and ensures that communities feel heard and valued. 

* Incorporate local knowledge and practices into anticipatory action plans. Communities often have deep, context-specific understanding of their environment and risks, which can enhance the effectiveness of interventions. 

* Ensure that engagement strategies are inclusive, reaching all segments of the community, including vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. This ensures that the needs of the most at-risk populations are addressed.
