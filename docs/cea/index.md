# Community Engagement & Accountability

*Work in progress.*

Community Engagement & Accountability (CEA) is essential to help the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement build the acceptance and trust that is needed to deliver lifesaving work. One of the most effective ways of building this trust is to make sure that people can always engage with National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and to guarantee that National Societies will act based on their feedback and needs. Achieving this requires a systematic, consistent and high-quality approach to how we engage with and are accountable to communities.

Our goal is to work with National Societies on building trust, enhancing relevance and improving the quality of programmes by providing easy-to-use, safe and transparent digital tools for meaningful and scalable engagement with communities and simple processes for creating actionable insights.
