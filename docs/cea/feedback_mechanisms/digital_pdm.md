# Digital Post-Distribution Monitoring Form

## Challenge 

Traditional methods of post-distribution monitoring (PDM) can be time-consuming and inefficient, particularly when conducted on-site. Organizations may struggle to gather accurate data on aid distribution and program outcomes, leading to gaps in accountability and responsiveness. 

## Need 

Organizations require an efficient and scalable method for conducting PDM, especially when distributing aid to large populations. Digital tools can streamline the monitoring process, making it easier to collect feedback and track the effectiveness of aid programs. 

## Solution 

NLRC-510 provides a service to implement a Digital Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) Form using tools like Kobo Toolbox, EspoCRM, chatbots and mass messaging software. This service allows organizations to collect post-distribution data digitally, enabling more timely and accurate assessments of aid programs. An example of how a digital PDM can be used: the aid worker sends out a one-way WhatsApp message in bulk to a group of people asking to fill in a digital PDM. The receivers respond to this and they can answer the PDM questions using WhatsApp as their preferred channel. The data is then uploaded to the aid worker so that the results of the PDM can be easily analyzed.  

## Application 

This service is ideal for humanitarian organizations that distribute aid, whether in-kind or cash. By digitizing the PDM process, organizations can quickly gather feedback from beneficiaries and assess the impact of their distribution efforts. 

## Methodology 

NLRC-510 helps set up the digital PDM tools, provides training on data collection and management, and ensures that the system is integrated with existing platforms. The service includes configuring forms and setting up feedback loops to address community concerns. 

## Expected outcome 

Organizations will be able to conduct PDM more efficiently, ensuring that they can assess the effectiveness of aid distribution and address any issues in a timely manner. The digital approach improves accountability and allows for quicker response to community feedback.
