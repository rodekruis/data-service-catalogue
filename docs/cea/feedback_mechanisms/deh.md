# Digital Engagement Hub (DEH) 

## Challenge 

In humanitarian contexts, communication between organizations and affected communities can be fragmented, inefficient, or limited in scope. Existing systems may struggle to scale up during large-scale crises, leading to delays in feedback, missed opportunities for engagement, and reduced trust from communities. Organizations need a robust, flexible digital platform to manage communication with communities across multiple channels. 

## Need 

There is a need for a centralized digital platform that supports scalable, two-way communication between humanitarian organizations and the communities they serve. This platform should allow for real-time feedback, social media interaction, and mass messaging, all while being adaptable to the specific context of the organization and the communities involved. 

## Solution 

NLRC-510 offers the implementation of the Digital Engagement Hub (DEH), a comprehensive digital infrastructure designed to streamline communication between humanitarian aid workers and community members. This service includes setting up the DEH using components EspoCRM, Twilio Flex, and potentially Kobo Toolbox, providing organizations with a multi-channel communication system that supports two-way engagement, from chatbots and SMS to social media and mass messaging. 

## Application 

The DEH is suitable for National Societies, humanitarian organizations, and NGOs seeking to improve their digital engagement with communities. It enables them to send critical information, gather feedback, and respond to community concerns across a variety of digital platforms, ensuring a scalable and responsive communication system during both crisis and recovery phases. 

## Methodology 

NLRC-510 helps install, configure, and train staff on the DEH product. The process includes setting up the required technical infrastructure, integrating it with existing communication tools, and training users on how to manage and maintain the system. The service also covers the creation of custom workflows and message templates tailored to the organization’s needs, ensuring smooth and consistent communication.

## Expected outcome 

Organizations will have a fully operational Digital Engagement Hub that allows them to engage with communities at scale. This improves responsiveness, accountability, and transparency in communication, ultimately building stronger relationships between aid workers and the communities they serve. The DEH enhances the organization’s ability to gather and act on feedback quickly, closing the feedback loop in real time.
