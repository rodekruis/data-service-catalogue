# Implement Helpful Information App (HIA) 

## Challenge 

Humanitarian organizations often face challenges in disseminating vital information quickly and efficiently to large populations, especially during emergencies. Traditional methods may not reach all affected individuals, particularly those in remote areas. 

## Need 

There is a need for a mobile app that can deliver essential information, such as aid updates, program details, and crisis response information, directly to communities. The app should be user-friendly, accessible and capable of reaching a wide audience. 

## Solution 

NLRC-510 offers the implementation of the Helpful Information App (HIA), a tool designed to disseminate information to communities during crises. This service includes setting up, configuring, and training National Societies to use the app effectively to share real-time information with communities. HIA is open-source software and more information can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rodekruis/helpful-information). 

## Application 

The HIA is applicable to organizations that need to quickly share updates with affected populations during crises or aid distribution efforts. It provides a streamlined way to ensure that critical information reaches everyone, including those in hard-to-reach areas. To give you an idea, you can check out [this HIA](https://helpfulinformation-faq.redcross.nl/ukraine) from the Netherlands Red Cross for providing answers to people affected from Ukraine.

## Methodology 

NLRC-510 assists in setting up and configuring the app, followed by training sessions for staff on its use. The app can be customized to meet the specific needs of the organization and the communities they serve, ensuring it remains relevant and effective. 

## Expected outcome 

Organizations will be equipped with a mobile app that allows them to provide timely and accurate information to affected communities. This enhances communication and helps ensure that communities are informed about aid programs, emergency updates and more. If you are interested, you can have a look at the open-source [HIA docs](https://github.com/rodekruis/helpful-information).
