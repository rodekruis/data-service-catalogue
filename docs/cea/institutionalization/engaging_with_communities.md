# Engaging with communities

## Challenge 

Many humanitarian programs struggle to engage communities meaningfully, particularly in ensuring that community voices are represented in the decision-making process, as stated in ALNAPâ€™s "State of the Humanitarian System" (2022). Without active community participation, programs risk being less effective or mismatched with actual needs. 

## Need 

There is a need for structured approaches to increase community participation in humanitarian efforts. To increase accountability to community members, organizations must foster an environment where communities feel empowered to share their perspectives and contribute to shaping programs that affect them directly. 

## Solution 

NLRC-510 can support your national society in developing an approach to increasing community participation in the design and implementation of programs and operations. We can support  organizing activities such as focus group discussions and awareness campaigns.  

## Application 

This service is ideal for National Societies and organizations that aim to strengthen community engagement in their programs. 

## Methodology 

The service involves organizing focus group discussions, community consultations, and awareness campaigns. NLRC-510 also provides guidance on creating inclusive participation mechanisms, ensuring marginalized voices are heard and considered in decision-making. We provide tools and training to ensure communities can participate in shaping the services they receive, from initial planning to implementation and evaluation. 

## Expected outcome 

Organizations will achieve greater community involvement in their humanitarian efforts, leading to programs that are better aligned with community needs. This approach fosters trust and improves the overall impact and sustainability of interventions.
