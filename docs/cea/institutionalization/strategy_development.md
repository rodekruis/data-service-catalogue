# Strategy Development

## Challenge 

Humanitarian organizations often face challenges embedding community engagement and accountability (CEA) into their operational frameworks. Without clear strategies, community feedback can be overlooked, leading to programs that donâ€™t fully address the needs of the people they aim to support. This disconnect can reduce the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions, limit community trust, and hinder long-term program success. 

## Need 

Organizations require a structured, actionable CEA strategy to guide their teams in consistently engaging communities, gathering feedback, and ensuring accountability. A comprehensive approach is needed to ensure these strategies address community concerns effectively and align with organizational capacities. 

## Solution 

NLRC-510 offers a service to organize and assist with the development of CEA strategies. This includes multiple analysis, assessments and workshops to guide the process. We use the IFRC CEA Toolkit to ensure consistency and clarity in the strategy's development, empowering organizations to create inclusive, community-focused programs. NLRC-510 can offer support with developing the full CEA strategy, but we can also consult on components such as digital CEA.

## Application 

This service is for National Societies and humanitarian organizations looking to embed community engagement in their core operations. Through consultations and workshops, the service helps leadership teams create guidelines and metrics of success, ensuring that CEA becomes an integral part of their organizational culture.  

## Methodology 

The service follows a systematic approach to strategy development, starting with a gap analysis and needs assessment. Stakeholder workshops are conducted, utilizing tools from the IFRC CEA toolkit, and metrics of success are defined to measure the effectiveness of the strategy. 

 

## Expected outcome 

Organizations will have a clear, actionable CEA strategy that outlines specific roles, responsibilities, and measurable outcomes. The strategy will enable them to better engage with communities, build trust, and improve the relevance and effectiveness of their programs.
