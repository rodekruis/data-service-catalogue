# Data Protection

## Challenge 

Handling community feedback data involves processing sensitive data, which includes personal data and other non-personal data that can be deemed sensitive due to the context. Processing sensitive data can lead to negative impacts which can create risks related to privacy and data security. Humanitarian organizations may not have the technical expertise to assess and mitigate these risks adequately, which can lead to unintentional breaches of data protection international standards and applicable legislation or unintentional harm to communities.  

## Need 

Organizations need a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of their data processing activities on privacy and to ensure that all community feedback is handled securely. A robust data protection framework is essential to maintain community trust and comply with legal requirements. 

## Solution

It is particularly useful for National Societies and humanitarian organizations looking to implement feedback mechanisms, surveys, or digital tools that handle community data. 

## Methodology 

The service includes an in-depth assessment of the organization's data flow, a risk evaluation, and the implementation of measures to ensure data security. Workshops and consultations are conducted to train staff on best practices for data handling and protection. 

## Expected outcome 

Organizations will have a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved in processing community feedback data and will be equipped with the tools and knowledge needed to ensure privacy protection. This will help maintain community trust and improve compliance with data protection regulations.
